    <!--Client-side vs. server-side redirection-->
    <div class="layout">
      <h4 class="header-text">Client-side vs. server-side redirection</h4>
      <p class="text">
        When it comes to directing a user from one webpage to another there are two different ways of approaching this. There is the client-side redirection where the redirection is handled by user's browser where there is no need for the browser to make additional request to the server for redirection. So when a user's brower requests a server and retrives the HTML page, the server responds with the HTML content and JavaScript code, which includes instructions for client-side redirection in javacscript code. The browers will process the redirection instructions locally, without the need to make another request to the server and can redirect the user to specific URL on the client-side.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="layout center-layout">
      <p class="text">
        The other way is server-side redirection, where the server sends back a HTTP response instructing browser to redirect to a different URL. This could be by the user clicking on a link on webpage or typing in an URL in the address bar in the browser. Either way the server recieves the request and determines that it needs to redirect to another webpage, because the requested webpage maybe has been moved. The server returns a HTTP response with the URL to which the browser should be redirected to and when the browser recieves the response it will automatically make a new request for the URL recieved and the server will respond back with the content specified to that URL. The picture below shows how a redirection can be done in Express, where the old-webpage represents the page the user wants to visit, when making a request to that endpoint it redirects the reponse to the new-webpage.
      </p>

      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        import express from 'express';

        const app = express();

        app.get("/new-webpage", (req, res) => {
          res.send({ data: "new-page" });
        })

        app.get("/old-webpage", (req, res) => {
          res.redirect("/new-webpage"); 
        });

        const PORT = 8181;
        app.listen(PORT, () => {
          console.log("Server is running on", PORT);
        })
      </code></pre>

      <!--Server-side vs. client-side rendering.-->
    <div class="layout margin-top50">
      <h4 class="header-text">Server-side rendering vs. Client-side rendering</h4>
      <h4 class="header-text size18">SSR</h4>
      <p class="text">
        In server-side rendering, the HTML content is generated on the server and delivered to the user's browser as whole HTML document. This means that when the user loads the webpage, they recieve a fully rendered HTML directly from the server. 
      </p>

      <h4 class="header-text size18">CSR</h4>
      <p class="text">
        On the other hand, in client-side rendering, the HTML content recieved from the server is being rendering and content generation happens on the client side, using JavaScript or libraries. After the initial HTML has been loaded, the client-side code will use JavaScript to fetch data from an API and dynamically update the Document Object Model (DOM) to render content
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="layout">
      <h4 class="header-text size18">Server-side</h4>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>SSR typically results in faster load times bacause the server send prerendered HTML content to the browser and it can be displayed immediatly. But SSR can have longer time to interactive making the user wait because additional JavaScript resourses needs to load.</li>
        <li>SSR reduces client-side processing and memory usage as the server performs rendering and sends fully formed HTML content to the client. But SSR can increase the server load, especially if an applicaition have a large number of users at the same time. Because the server needs to generate HTML content for each request.</li>
        <li>SSR is preferred for SEO as search engine crawlers can easily parse and index pre-rendered HTML content.</li>
        <li>SSR can help avoid CORS issues by centralizing data fetching and rendering on the server, reducing the need for cross-origin requests.</li>
        <li>SRR also helps in those instances where browser / clients have turned of JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="layout">
      <h4 class="header-text size18">Client-side</h4>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>CSR may have faster load times after the initial page has been loaded bacause if any other date is needed to fetched and updated to the DOM, it doesn't have make a full page reload. But CSR can often lead to slower load times because there can be JavaScript resourses that takes longer to download and execute before rendering the page.</li>
        <li>CSR takes away the rendering tasks from server to the client, reducing server load. But CSR can result in higher client-side processing and memory usage. Especially if it is complex/large application.</li>
      </ul>

    <!--Reading files-->
    <div class="layout center-layout margin-top50">
      <h4 class="header-text">Reading files</h4>
      <p class="text">
        All the webpage in this portfolio is generated using server-side rendering. Where the header and footer parts for of html is made into small components and assembled with the main content in the middle. Just like a burger. For being able to do this, we use the function 'fs.readFileSync()' in Node.js that is part of its file system module. When using this function Node.ks will read the file from the filesystem and block the main thread until the entire file is read. Meaning that while the HTML file is being read all other execution of code will pause, untill it is finished. This allows the the server to render the HTML content before sending it to the client.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Seen in the picture below, the 'fs' is imported and it allows us to use it '.readFileSync()' function. Here we parse the path to the HTML file and the 'toString()' turns the filebuffer into a string using UTF-8 endcoding. We could also have specified it in the like this '.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')'.
      </p>
      
      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        import fs from 'fs';

        export function readPage(path) {
          return fs.readFileSync(path).toString();
        }
        
        const footer = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/footer/footer.html").toString();
        
        export function renderPage(page, config={}) {
          const header = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/header/header.html").toString();
          return header.replace("$tabTitle$", config.tabTitle || "Portfolio")
          .replace("$CSS_link$", config.CSS_link || "") 
          + page
          + footer;
        }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="layout center-layout">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>So as seen in the picture the 'readPage' function reads the page, turns it into a string and returns it.</li>
        <li>In 'footer' variable we read the file too but it's not returned because it static and never changes.</li>
        <li>Inside the 'renderPage' function the page that as read an return is being passed as 'page' and for the 'header' variable the same is done as the 'footer'.</li>
        <li>Lastly the function concatenate the files to one big string 'header + page + footer' and it is ready to be sent to the client.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--Nodemon-->
    <div class="layout margin-top50 center-layout">
      <h4 class="header-text">Nodemon extension</h4>
      <p class="text">
        As an extension to the Nodemon chapter in <a href="/servingHtmlFiles">Serving Html</a> this Nodemon chapter will look a bit into the configuration. By default watches files with '.js, .mjs, .cjs, .json', which means only when there have been made changes to these files Nodemon will automatically restart. But when since we are working with server side rendering and html files, changes to these files won't be displayed automaticly for examaple when we have written new text. And in a our developent phase this is not optimal, because it either require us make a change in one of those default files being watched or close down Nodemon and start it again. Which kind of defeats the purpose of Nodemon when working fullstack. 
      </p>

      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        [nodemon] 3.1.0
        [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
        [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
        [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="layout margin-top20 center-layout">
      <p class="text">
        At the picture above you can se the default. But this we can change and there are two main ways of doing it. We can either go to our terminal and write 'nodemon --ext file extension', so we can tell it watch only '.js and html' like 'nodemon --ext js,html'.
      </p>

      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        PS C:\Users\jespe\Desktop\4.Semster\Node\nodeplayground> nodemon --ext js,html
        [nodemon] 3.1.0
        [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
        [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
        [nodemon] watching extensions: js,html
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="layout margin-top20 center-layout">
      <p class="text">
        The other way is to make a configuration file. Nodemon supports locally an globally configuration files and you can even place it the configuration your package.json if you want to keep all in one place. But for this we will make 'nodemon.json' file and added to our project. As shown in the picture below we add a 'nodemon.json' file and in that file tell it watch the "ext": "js, json, html"<div class=""></div>
      </p>

      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        {
          "ext": "js, json, html"
        }
      </code></pre>

      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        PS C:\Users\jespe\Desktop\4.Semster\Node\NodeMandatoryI> nodemon .\app.js
        [nodemon] 3.1.0

        For more details about different configurations you can also visit Nodemons <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon" target="_blank">Github</a> or you go to your terminal and write 'nodemon -h'. It will give you a list of options, commands and more. As you can see in the picture one of the first options is how to make Nodemon watch for extensions.
      </p>

      <pre class="language-javascript snippet-layout snippet-center"><code>
        PS C:\Users\jespe\Desktop\4.Semster\Node\nodeplayground> nodemon -h
        Usage: nodemon [options] [script.js] [args]
      
        Options:
      
        --config file ............ alternate nodemon.json config file to use
        -e, --ext ................ extensions to look for, ie. js,pug,hbs.
        -x, --exec app ........... execute script with "app", ie. -x "python -v".
        -w, --watch path ......... watch directory "path" or files. use once for
                                   each directory or file to watch.
        -i, --ignore ............. ignore specific files or directories.
        -V, --verbose ............ show detail on what is causing restarts.
        -- <your args> ........... to tell nodemon stop slurping arguments.
      
        Note: if the script is omitted, nodemon will try to read "main" from
        package.json and without a nodemon.json, nodemon will monitor .js, .mjs, .coffee,
        .litcoffee, and .json by default.
      
        For advanced nodemon configuration use nodemon.json: nodemon --help config
        See also the sample: https://github.com/remy/nodemon/wiki/Sample-nodemon.json
      
        Examples:
      
        $ nodemon server.js
        $ nodemon -w ../foo server.js apparg1 apparg2
        $ nodemon --exec python app.py
        $ nodemon --exec "make build" -e "styl hbs"
        $ nodemon app.js -- --config # pass config to app.js
      
        All options are documented under: nodemon --help options
