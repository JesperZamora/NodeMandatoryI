      <p class="text">
        When it comes to directing a user from one webpage to another there are two different ways of approaching this. There is the client-side redirection where the redirection is handled by user's browser where there is no need for the browser to make additional request to the server for redirection. So when a user's brower requests a server and retrives the HTML page, the server responds with the HTML content and JavaScript code, which includes instructions for client-side redirection in javacscript code. The browers will process the redirection instructions locally, without the need to make another request to the server and can redirect the user to specific URL on the client-side.

      <p class="text">
        The other way is server-side redirection, where the server sends back a HTTP response instructing browser to redirect to a different URL. This could be by the user clicking on a link on webpage or typing in an URL in the address bar in the browser. Either way the server recieves the request and determines that it needs to redirect to another webpage, because the requested webpage maybe has been moved. The server returns a HTTP response with the URL to which the browser should be redirected to and when the browser recieves the response it will automatically make a new request for the URL recieved and the server will respond back with the content specified to that URL. The picture below shows how a redirection can be done in Express, where the old-webpage represents the page the user wants to visit, when making a request to that endpoint it redirects the reponse to the new-webpage.

        Under “normal” conditions you would have to start you application by writing `node app.js` for starting it and end it by `clt + c`, in your terminal. By not have to do these simple steps you save time and effort on not having to restart your app each time you have made a change, plus you can concentrate on writing code.

        As an extension to the Nodemon chapter in <a href="/servingHtmlFiles">Serving Html</a> this Nodemon chapter will look a bit into the configuration. By default watches files with '.js, .mjs, .cjs, .json', which means only when there have been made changes to these files Nodemon will automatically restart. But when since we are working with server side rendering and html files, changes to these files won't be displayed automaticly for examaple when we have written new text. And in a our developent phase this is not optimal, because it either require us make a change in one of those default files being watched or close down Nodemon and start it again. Which kind of defeats the purpose of Nodemon when working fullstack.

        At the picture above you can se the default. But this we can change and there are two main ways of doing it. We can either go to our terminal and write 'nodemon --ext file extension', so we can tell it watch only '.js and html' like 'nodemon --ext js,html'.

        The other way is to make a configuration file. Nodemon supports locally an globally configuration files and you can even place it the configuration your package.json if you want to keep all in one place. But for this we will make 'nodemon.json' file and added to our project. As shown in the picture below we add a 'nodemon.json' file and in that file tell it watch the "ext": "js, json, html"<div class=""></div>

        For more details about different configurations you can also visit Nodemons <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon" target="_blank">Github</a> or you go to your terminal and write 'nodemon -h'. It will give you a list of options, commands and more. As you can see in the picture one of the first options is how to make Nodemon watch for extensions.
