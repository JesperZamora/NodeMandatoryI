      <p class="text">
        A script refers to a file containg code that can be executed and in Node.js it would be a JavaScript file contaning code that can be executed using the Node.js runtime. Scripts can be used for many things such as running test, builds, deployment, running web server, task automation etc. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In our package.json file we can define scripts using the 'scripts' field as a key-value pair. The key is the script name and the value is the command to run the script. To run a script in Node.js, in the terminal we will write 'npm run keyname'. Node.js will now execute the corresponding command specified and the script in the package.json file.

        The picture above shows the package.json file and in the 'scripts' field I have defined the 'key' to be 'myscript' and the value to 'nodemon.cmd ./app.js'. Now when I type 'npm run myscript' it will execute the nodemon and run app.js.

        Nodemon is a utility tool that monitors changes in your Node.js application’s source code and automatically restarts the server when changes have been detected. It is very useful during development as it saves you time by not having to manually stop and restart your server yourself.

By not have to do these simple steps you save time and effort on not having to restart your app each time you have made a change, plus you can concentrate on writing code.
